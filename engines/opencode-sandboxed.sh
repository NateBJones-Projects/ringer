# Ringer engine wrapper: run OpenCode under a macOS Seatbelt sandbox.
#
# OpenCode has no OS-level sandbox of its own — its --dangerously-skip-permissions
# flag (required for headless runs) disables ALL of its interactive approval
# prompts. This wrapper supplies the real containment: full network, reads open
# outside the run workdir, reads inside the run confined to the current task,
# and writes confined to the task dir, a per-run scratch/cache dir, and
# OpenCode's own state dirs.
#
# Usage (as a ringer engine bin):
#   opencode-sandboxed.sh <taskdir> [--no-sandbox] <opencode args...>
#
# The first argument is the task directory (pass "{taskdir}" first in
# args_template). "--no-sandbox" as the second argument skips Seatbelt entirely
# — wire it as the engine's full_access_args so ringer's allow_full_access gate
# still applies. macOS only (sandbox-exec); on other platforms only
# --no-sandbox mode works.
